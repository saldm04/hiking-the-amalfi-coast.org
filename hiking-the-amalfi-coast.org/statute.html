  <h1 class="mb-4">Bylaws of the Hiking The Amalfi Coast Social Promotion Association</h1>
  <p class="text-muted">This English translation is provided for convenience only. In case of discrepancy, the Italian original (<a href="statuto.html" class="text-decoration-underline">Statuto</a>) prevails.</p>

  <p class="fw-bold">PURPOSE AND AIMS</p>

  <p><strong>Article 1 – ESTABLISHMENT</strong> – The social promotion association “Hiking The Amalfi Coast” is established in accordance with Articles 14–42 (in particular Article 36) of the Italian Civil Code. Its registered office is in Via De Jusola 5, Maiori (SA). The association is governed by these bylaws and the applicable laws. The Board of Directors may resolve to open additional operational offices or change the registered or main operational office. The association operates pursuant to Legislative Decree 117/2017 and subsequent amendments, the implementing provisions, regional laws and the general principles of the Italian legal system. The Assembly may approve internal regulations to govern specific organisational aspects.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 2 – ACTIVITIES</strong> – The association may carry out recreational and cultural activities, as well as sports-related initiatives, including educational, pedagogical and social promotion programmes that benefit members and third parties. All activities are non-profit and inspired by the principles of democracy and equal rights. Ancillary or related commercial activities may be undertaken in compliance with the applicable laws. The association has no time limit. It pursues civic, solidarity and socially useful objectives by continuously performing activities of general interest pursuant to Article 5 of Legislative Decree 117/2017, as amended by Article 3 of Legislative Decree 105/2018. The association promotes cultural and nature-based hiking—including experiential initiatives—through the restoration of trail networks, maps, guides, technological tools and publications, and coordinates protection and conservation initiatives for the trail system of the Monti Lattari.</p>

  <p>To achieve these aims and act for the benefit of the community, the association intends to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>restore and clear paths and trails;</li>
    <li>maintain local trail signage;</li>
    <li>organise guided walks;</li>
    <li>host cultural events—also in partnership with other organisations—to promote the region;</li>
    <li>carry out any other activity connected with the above, performing any act or contractual operation necessary or useful for the direct or indirect fulfilment of the institutional purposes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The activities listed above, or directly related ones, are mainly aimed at third parties and are performed on an ongoing basis primarily through the personal, voluntary and unpaid contribution of members. Employees may be hired or self-employed professionals engaged, including among members, where permitted by third-sector regulations. The association may carry out activities different from those of general interest, provided they are secondary and instrumental, in accordance with current third-sector legislation and the procedures defined by the Board of Directors. It may also organise fundraising initiatives pursuant to Article 7 of Legislative Decree 117/2017, adhering to principles of truth, transparency and fairness toward supporters and the public. Provisions incompatible with the status of non-profit (ONLUS) will take effect when allowed by transitional rules. The association operates throughout the Amalfi Coast and the Monti Lattari.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 3 – TASKS</strong> – The association shall:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>organise events, workshops, fairs, markets, conferences, courses, tastings, press meetings and conventions connected to its mission;</li>
    <li>submit proposals to public entities to promote and disseminate the aforementioned activities;</li>
    <li>provide educational initiatives for members to research and explore topics related to institutional activities;</li>
    <li>promote, disseminate and practice cultural, artistic, recreational and leisure activities to encourage interaction among members and support training programmes and study initiatives;</li>
    <li>run cultural, recreational and leisure centres or camps during summer and winter;</li>
    <li>organise conferences, congresses, trips, courses, research centres and training within the educational, recreational and leisure fields;</li>
    <li>manage or rent any type of facility, real estate or equipment, enter into agreements with other associations or third parties, relocate the head office or open secondary offices in Italy or abroad, and carry out any financial, real estate or asset transaction deemed useful, necessary or relevant;</li>
    <li>carry out commercial operations in compliance with non-profit legislation, including preparatory or related activities;</li>
    <li>offer opportunities for engagement and personal growth, promoting social, cultural, educational and recreational inclusion;</li>
    <li>contribute to community life with cultural initiatives, requesting grants, funding, contributions and sponsorships from public and private bodies;</li>
    <li>support entities, institutions and voluntary associations with similar goals;</li>
    <li>make use of external collaborators (actors, set designers, technicians, IT specialists, singers, musicians, artists, teachers, social workers, educators) as needed;</li>
    <li>manage public or private facilities and spaces, including international exchanges;</li>
    <li>directly manage theatres, arts venues, music schools, recording studios and workshops, including entire buildings entrusted to the association;</li>
    <li>provide bar and catering services to members;</li>
    <li>undertake any other activity connected with the above goals;</li>
    <li>participate in companies or consortia whose activities complement those of the association;</li>
    <li>foster friendship and solidarity among citizens;</li>
    <li>encourage local development through cooperation, collaboration and dialogue between private and public stakeholders;</li>
    <li>use any tool useful to pursue social goals, especially by cooperating with local authorities through agreements and by joining associations, companies or entities with similar or related aims;</li>
    <li>carry out any economic or financial transaction, whether movable or immovable, to better achieve its aims;</li>
    <li>undertake ancillary activities exclusively for self-financing and without profit, as allowed by law;</li>
    <li>implement any other initiative or activity necessary or appropriate to achieve the goals described above;</li>
    <li>uphold gender equality and the inalienable rights of the individual.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Article 4 – MEMBERSHIP</strong> – Any individual or legal entity without profit-making purposes that shares the association’s goals and accepts these bylaws may join without discrimination. Members have equal rights and duties; any restrictions or exclusions must be justified and strictly connected to the association’s social promotion aims. Membership is unlimited. Founding members and any individual committed to the association’s mission are part of the association. Applications by minors must be countersigned by a parent or guardian, while legal entities must apply through their legal representative. Membership is permanent and may cease only in the cases listed in Article 5. Admissions that violate this principle by introducing arbitrary criteria are not allowed. All citizens of any gender may join. Members of legal age are entitled to vote upon admission, and each member has one vote.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 5 – LOSS OF MEMBERSHIP</strong> – Membership may cease due to withdrawal, failure to pay dues, death, loss of legal requirements, gross misconduct or serious behaviour damaging to the association. Withdrawal must be communicated in writing to the Board of Directors. Members who resign, are excluded or die have no right to reimbursement of fees or contributions. Exclusion may be decided by the Board of Directors if a member fails to comply with bylaws or resolutions, engages in behaviour contrary to the association’s aims, fails to pay dues for two consecutive years or causes moral or material damage to the association. The Assembly must ratify the Board’s decision at the first opportunity. Excluded members cannot be readmitted, except those expelled for non-payment, who may rejoin after paying the membership fee subject to approval by the next Assembly.</p>

  <p class="fw-bold">ASSETS</p>

  <p><strong>Article 10 – ASSETS</strong> – The association’s financial resources come from:</p>

It is forbidden to distribute, even indirectly, profits, surpluses, funds, reserves or capital, unless required by law. Operating surpluses must be used to carry out institutional activities and directly related initiatives. The financial year runs from 1 January to 31 December.

  <p><strong>Article 11 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</strong> – The financial year begins on 1 January. Financial statements are prepared pursuant to Articles 13 and 87 of Legislative Decree 117/2017 and related regulations, and must provide a true and fair view of the association’s financial position and performance.

  <p><strong>Article 12 – INCOME</strong> – The association is non-profit and its income may never be distributed to members, even indirectly. Profits or operating surpluses, funds, reserves or capital may not be distributed during the life of the association (Article 8(2) Legislative Decree 117/2017). Assets—including any revenues, income, proceeds or earnings—must be used exclusively for statutory activities aimed at achieving the association’s goals. Any surplus must be reinvested to pursue institutional purposes or to purchase or renew facilities, equipment and assets, or as otherwise required by law. A social report is prepared in the cases and in the manner required by Article 14 of Legislative Decree 117/2017.</p>

  <p class="fw-bold">GOVERNING BODIES</p>

  <p><strong>Article 13 – GOVERNING BODIES</strong> – The association’s bodies are:</p>

    <li>the Administrative Body;</li>
    <li>the President;</li>

    <li>the Supervisory Body (optional).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Elections are free and unrestricted, guaranteeing the broadest participation in both active and passive voting rights.</p>

  <p class="fw-bold">ASSEMBLY</p>

  <p><strong>Article 14 – ASSEMBLY</strong> – The general assembly of members is the association’s supreme decision-making body. It meets in ordinary and extraordinary sessions. It is sovereign and the governing body implements its resolutions. Members of legal age who have paid their membership dues for the current year may vote. A member may grant up to five proxies to other members. The Assembly is convened by the President of the Administrative Body at least once a year to approve the financial statements and whenever deemed necessary by the President, at least three directors or one tenth of the members. It is chaired by the President or, in his/her absence, by the Vice-President or another member elected by those present. Notices are sent in writing, on paper or electronically, at least fifteen days before the meeting. The Assembly is validly constituted on first call when at least half of the members are present or represented; on second call—held at least thirty minutes later, on a different day—it is valid regardless of the number of members attending. Ordinary resolutions are adopted by a majority of votes.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 15 – EXTRAORDINARY ASSEMBLY</strong> – The Extraordinary Assembly is convened whenever the Board of Directors deems it necessary or upon request by at least half of the members. It resolves on amendments to the bylaws, transformation, merger or division and dissolution of the association. To amend the bylaws, a majority of the members plus one is required on first call; on second call, at least half of the members (in person or by proxy) must be present and three quarters of those present must vote in favour. If the quorum is not met in second call, a third call may be held at least fifteen days later; in this case, amendments are valid regardless of attendance, provided they are approved unanimously. Dissolution and allocation of assets require the vote of at least three quarters of the members. In decisions concerning the financial statements or the liability of governing bodies, directors have no voting rights.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 16 – CONVENING THE ASSEMBLY</strong> – On first call, both ordinary and extraordinary assemblies are duly constituted with the presence of at least half plus one of the members. On second call the Assembly, regardless of the number present, validly resolves by absolute majority of votes of members in attendance on all agenda items.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 17 – DISSOLUTION</strong> – The association may be dissolved by the Assembly convened in extraordinary session. Dissolution also occurs if the minimum number of directors required by law is not met and new members are not elected within a reasonable time, resulting in the termination of the association due to the absence of the governing body in charge of coordinating institutional activities. Upon dissolution, the Assembly shall decide on the destination of any remaining assets, which must be assigned to another association with similar purposes or, if applicable, according to Law 289/2002 and subsequent amendments, or other legislative provisions, as provided by Article 148(8)(b) TUIR.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 18 – VOTING</strong> – Votes may be taken by a show of hands or by secret ballot. All members entitled to vote may take part.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 19 – PRESIDENT OF THE ASSEMBLY</strong> – Ordinary and extraordinary assemblies are chaired by a President appointed by the Assembly itself. All resolutions must be recorded in the minutes book.</p>

  <p class="fw-bold">BOARD OF DIRECTORS</p>

  <p><strong>Article 20 – BOARD OF DIRECTORS</strong> – The administrative body consists of no fewer than three and no more than seven members elected by the Assembly. Directors serve for three years and may be re-elected for two consecutive terms. Only members may serve. If a director resigns or otherwise leaves office, the Assembly shall replace the member at the next meeting, or the Board may appoint the first non-elected candidate, subject to ratification by the Assembly, to serve until the end of the term. If more than half the directors leave office, the Assembly must appoint new members. The Board of Directors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>appoints from among its members a President, Vice-President and Secretary;</li>
    <li>ensures that Assembly resolutions are carried out;</li>
    <li>prepares the financial statements or reports;</li>
    <li>rules on membership applications and the exclusion of members;</li>
    <li>approves any internal regulations and amendments;</li>
    <li>manages ordinary and extraordinary administration not reserved to the Assembly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Board is chaired by the President or, in his/her absence, by the Vice-President or the most senior member. Meetings are convened with written notice (including by email) at least fifteen days in advance; if all directors are present, the meeting is valid even without formal notice. The Board usually meets every six months or whenever the President (or Vice-President) deems it necessary, or when at least two-thirds of the members request it. Resolutions are valid with the presence of the majority of members and a majority vote of those present. When the Board has only three members, meetings are valid only if all are present. Minutes of each meeting are drafted by the Secretary (or the acting secretary), signed by both the Secretary and the President, and kept on file.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 21 – LEGAL REPRESENTATION</strong> – The President represents the association before third parties and in court, holds legal representation and acts as authorised signatory. The President is responsible for the overall management and proper conduct of the association, signs documents that bind the association to members and third parties, and may open and manage bank accounts, including with sole signature. The President oversees the implementation of Assembly and Board decisions and may delegate specific tasks to one or more directors. In the event of absence or impediment, the Vice-President assumes all related powers.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 22 – SOLE AUDITOR</strong> – If appointed, the Sole Auditor performs administrative oversight and is elected by the Assembly, even from outside the membership. The Auditor’s term coincides with that of the Board of Directors and may be renewed. The Auditor monitors the association’s administration, verifies that the financial statements correspond to the accounting records and ensures compliance with these bylaws. The Auditor may attend Board and Assembly meetings without voting rights and prepares an annual report on the financial statements.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 23 – SUPERVISORY BODY</strong> – The Supervisory Body, which may be single-member, is appointed in the cases and according to the procedures set out in Article 30 of Legislative Decree 117/2017. It:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>monitors compliance with the law, these bylaws and principles of proper governance;</li>
    <li>verifies the adequacy and effective operation of the organisational, administrative and accounting structure;</li>
    <li>monitors adherence to civic, solidarity and socially useful purposes;</li>
    <li>certifies that the social report complies with the applicable guidelines;</li>
    <li>may, if the limits set out in Article 31 of Legislative Decree 117/2017 are exceeded, perform statutory auditing through registered auditors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Members of the Supervisory Body may carry out inspections and request information on the progress of operations or specific matters at any time. The body is appointed when required by Legislative Decree 117/2017.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 24 – PAID STAFF</strong> – The association may employ staff within the limits established by Article 36 of Legislative Decree 117/2017. Employment relationships are governed by law and by a specific regulation adopted by the association.</p>

  <p class="fw-bold">INSURANCE FOR THE ASSOCIATION AND VOLUNTEERS</p>

  <p><strong>Article 25</strong> – Volunteer members are insured against illness, accidents and third-party liability pursuant to Article 18 of Legislative Decree 117/2017. For obligations undertaken by representatives of the association, third parties may assert their rights against the common fund. The association may also obtain insurance coverage for contractual and non-contractual liability.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 26 – ARBITRATION CLAUSE</strong> – Any dispute concerning the interpretation or execution of these bylaws between governing bodies, between members, or between members and governing bodies shall be submitted to conciliation. The process is conducted by an independent, impartial and neutral conciliator, without formalities, within sixty days of appointment. If the conciliator is not designated in advance by the Assembly, the parties shall appoint one by mutual agreement; failing agreement within thirty days, the conciliator shall be appointed by the Assembly. The agreement reached with the conciliator has the same effect as a settlement directly concluded between the parties. If no agreement is reached, the dispute is definitively resolved by the first Assembly called for that purpose, by majority vote of its members.</p>

  <p class="fw-bold">DISSOLUTION OF THE ASSOCIATION</p>

  <p><strong>Article 27</strong> – Dissolution must be resolved by the Extraordinary Assembly with the favourable vote of at least three quarters of voting members. In the event of dissolution, the residual assets shall be assigned—subject to the positive opinion of the Regional Office of the National Register of the Third Sector and without prejudice to any legal obligations—to other third-sector entities pursuant to Legislative Decree 117/2017.</p>

  <p class="fw-bold">FINAL PROVISIONS</p>

  <p><strong>Article 28</strong> – The association affiliates with one or more entities recognised by the Ministry of the Interior, complying with their statutes, rules and regulations.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 29 – TRANSITIONAL RULES</strong></p>
  <p>The provisions of these bylaws that require the establishment and operation of the National Register of the Third Sector (RUNTS), or the adoption of subsequent legislative measures, shall apply once the register is set up and operating pursuant to law and the related implementing measures are enacted and enter into force.</p>
  <p>Bylaw clauses that are incompatible or in conflict with the Third Sector Code will cease to have effect from the date the RUNTS becomes operational.</p>
  <p>
    1. All requirements concerning registration in the RUNTS that are incompatible with current rules will take effect once the register is operational.<br>

    4. For associations registered, or intending to register, in the ONLUS register: the provisions of Articles 2, 15, 16 and 20 that are incompatible with ONLUS status will take effect only after registration with the RUNTS. While the association remains registered with the regional register of social promotion associations and the ONLUS registry, it must pursue exclusively purposes of social solidarity and is prohibited from:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;– carrying out activities other than those listed in Article 10(a) of Legislative Decree 460/1997, except for directly related activities;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;– distributing, even indirectly, profits, surpluses, funds, reserves or capital during the life of the association, unless required by law or made in favour of other ONLUS belonging to the same network.

  <ul>
    <li>use profits or operating surpluses to carry out institutional activities and directly related initiatives;</li>

  </ul>
  <p>The association shall include the wording “organizzazione non lucrativa di utilità sociale” (non-profit organisation of social utility) or the acronym “ONLUS” in its name and in any identifying mark or public communication.</p>

  <p><strong>Article 30</strong> – Any matters not covered by these bylaws are governed by Italian law, the general principles of the legal system and special laws on associations.</p>
